                    <p>Hello my name is Nathaniel McKain. I am a self made (not yet) millionaire who is always seeking knowledge and learn about my areas of interest. My areas of interest include jiu-jitsu, coding, fitness, and being married to Zahbia. I feel that know matter how much I learn about a subject, there is always more knoweldge to gain and someone I can inform about what they don't know. The pursuit of knowledge is never ending in life.</p>
